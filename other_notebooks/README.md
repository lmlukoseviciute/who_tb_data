I was seeking data on tuberculosis (TB) cases, along with information on each country's population size and income level, to conduct a comprehensive analysis. Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t locate this specific data on the WHO website, so I decided to devise a solution on my own. This involved a data pre-analysis step, which included merging multiple datasets and transforming them into the format I had envisioned. This notebook serves as the foundation for that preparation, and will be followed by another notebook dedicated to the actual data analysis. 
I obtained the [WHO TB data](https://www.who.int/teams/global-programme-on-tuberculosis-and-lung-health/data) from the WHO website, specifically the `Case notifications [>2Mb]` CSV file. The population data was sourced from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL), while the income classification information for countries was also retrieved from the [World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups), extracted from the `Current Classification by Income table in XLSX format`. All relevant files are available in the `data/raw_data` folder.
